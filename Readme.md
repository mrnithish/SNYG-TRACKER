The project is developed in MIT AppInventor, i.e., low-code development.In my first year, I learned about Mit AppInventor from a webinar I attended online. MIT App Inventor is a visual programming environment that allows users to create mobile applications (apps) for Android devices. It was initially created by MIT, and now a community of educators and developers maintains it.
